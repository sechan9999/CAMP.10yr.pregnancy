## May 12, 2020

- Copied over code from GC/CT, now working through from beginning of entire_project step by step.

- a10_import:  removed race mixing (not needed), and initial diagnoses.  Will need to replace the latter with initial pregnancies once we have them

- changed package name, set up NAMESPACE etc.  

## May 28, 2020

Plan today: continue through code step by step, and in the process:
- Remove males
- Redo incidence to reflect detectable pregnancies
- Simplify calibration code dramatically
- Identify full set of questions to return to team with

Tasks completed:
- Changed all setwd references
- removed males from a10_process_inputs.R
- removed males from a10_make_behav_inputs_all_2007.R
- removed a10_process_dx_for_calib altogether 
     (may need to create parallel file depending on age categories for pregnancy data -- it           seems that these may come in single-year age categories, so then won't need this step bu        rather just be combined into age categories more simply).
- rewrote a10_calib in numerous ways
- 


### Leave at bottom

Todo:
- change condom to bp throughout
- update costs
- get preg_init

Things to think about:
- need to replace dx input data with detactable pregnancy input data. What form will this come in? By age? By race/ethn?  By single years? All detectable pregs or by outcomes?
- need to decide what to calibrate to exactly - pregs? births?  in school or tot? by race/ethn?
- how to do regressions on BC options?

diag_init_X          -> preg_init           (CALIB TARGET)
condom_use_X         -> bc_use              multidimensional?
p_ethn_X             -> nothing
prop_diag_X          -> nothing?
dur_inf_X            -> nothing

# Outputs
